1. https://github.com/KexunNiu/CMPUT404/tree/main/Lab4/mysite

2. The browser showed me: The install worked successfully! Congratulations!; 
In the terminal, it shows me the request headers:  
"GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 16351
"GET /static/admin/css/fonts.css HTTP/1.1" 304 0
"GET /static/admin/fonts/Roboto-Regular-webfont.woff HTTP/1.1" 304 0
"GET /static/admin/fonts/Roboto-Bold-webfont.woff HTTP/1.1" 304 0
"GET /static/admin/fonts/Roboto-Light-webfont.woff HTTP/1.1" 304 0

3. When I navigating to '/', it shows Page not found and returns a Status 404.
When I navigating to '/polls', it shows the plain text "Hello. You're at the polls index."

4. Migration is when we made changes like add, remove to the models, and apply the changes to the database schema.
It has version-control system like git, so we need them to manage our databases.

5. I saw a log in page after I log into the Django administration site, I can get the custom models after log into the web.
And I saw we can Add and Change the model Choices and Questions we created.

6. /polls/38/: "You're looking at question 38."
   /polls/38/results: "You're looking at the results of question 38."
   /polls/38/vote: "You're voting on question 38."

   If I put a string instead of a number, it shows the error of Status 404.
   We can modify "<int:question_id>" to <str:question_id> to allow alphabetic characters.

7. It is not intelligent, and will make the code messy, it will apply the code convention without hardcode.

8. We can make it more convinent, we can quickly write common views of data without having to write too much code.
When we have multiple similar views, we should use generic views to reduce boilerplate code.
